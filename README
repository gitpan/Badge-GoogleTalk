DESCRIPTION

	A simple perl module for retrieving a user's Google Talk status
	Google does provide a badge, to post your status/images/links to your
	website to start a chat. Using this code, we can extract the status messages, online status,
	chat box link and return that information to our perl application to keep up the live chat.
